## Linked List

Linked list is a data structure that is a linear collection of items whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each item links to the next item. The last item links to a terminator used to mark the end of the list.

Singly linked list: a list where elements have only a reference to next element
Doubly linked list: a list where elements are linked to both next and previous elements

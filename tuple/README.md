# Tuple

A tuple is an ordered sequence of elements.
Elements of tuples are accessed by position (index).

# Example Case

Suppose you are creating a computer game and you want to allow the player to be able to pause and resume play at any time. When the game is paused, you must store the game data so that the game can be restarted where it was left off. A tuple could be used to collect together the data and then it could be written in a single operation to a binary file. When the player wished to pick up a game, the data could be loaded and the items read from the tuple into the relevant structures of the game.

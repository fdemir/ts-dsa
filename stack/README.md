# Stacks

Stacks are, on an abstract level, equivalent to linked lists. They are the ideal data structure
to model a First-In-Last-Out (FILO), or Last-In-First-Out (LIFO), strategy in search.

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack. The name "stack" for this type of structure comes from the analogy to a set of physical items stacked on top of each other. This structure makes it easy to take an item off the top of the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the stack may require taking off multiple other items first.

## Implementation

There are some basic operations that allow us to perform different actions on a stack.

- push(value): add an element to the top of a stack
- pop(): remove an element from the top of a stack
- peek(): get the value of the top element of a stack
- clear(): removes all the element in the stack
- isEmpty: check if the stack is empty
- size: get the value of the top element without removing it
